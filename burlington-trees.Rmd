# Introduction


# Visualization & Analysis

## Data Cleaning
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)

```

```{r data_clean}
# read in csv file
trees <- read.csv("./Burlington_Trees.csv")

# separate Geo.Point column to latitude and longitude
# and convert to numeric variables
trees <- trees %>% 
         separate(Geo.Point, c("lat", "long"), ",") %>% 
         mutate(lat = as.numeric(lat),
                long = as.numeric(long))

# convert zeros in numeric columns to NA so they will not be included in graphs
# in this case, zero values are due to lack of information, not lack of value,
# so all were converted to NA values to be filtered out later
# repeat for blank values
trees[trees == 0] <- NA
trees[trees == ""] <- NA

# convert dates to better format
trees <- trees %>% 
  mutate(modified = as.yearmon(modified, "%m/%Y"))

head(trees)

```

## Number of Trees by Species

```{r}
# number of trees by species
# histogram
```


## Relationship between species abundance and landuse

```{r}
# landuse v species
# multiple bar chart
# see if certain types of trees are more common by business, residential, etc.


```

## The Trees of Burlington

```{r land_use_distrib}
# will
# map of burlington with points as trees and colored by land use type
# map of burlington with points as trees and colored by species
# facet wrap them next to each other!

```

## Appraisal Estimates

```{r}
# diameter v appraisal
# scatterplot probably

```
